Author: Jixiang Wu
Maintainer: Jixiang Wu <jixiang.wu@sdstate.edu>
Description: This package offers three important components: (1) to construct a use-defined linear mixed model, (2) to employ one of linear mixed model approaches: minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation (MINQUE) (Rao, 1971) for variance component estimation and random effect prediction; and (3) to employ a jackknife resampling technique to conduct various statistical tests. In addition, this package provides the function for model or data evaluations.This R package offers fast computations for large data sets analyses for various irregular data structures.
